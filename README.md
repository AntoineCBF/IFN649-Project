We discovered the Teensy board by computing some simple programs in Arduino code.
Furthermore, I tried to use the connector board to connect a buzzer

## Tutorial 2
We connected the Teensy board with our computer in order to exchange data

## Tutorial 3
We learned how to exchange data between The RaspberryPI and the Teensy board through Bluetooth

## Tutorial 4
